The large movie reviews dataset (sometimes referred to as the IMDB dataset) contains *25,000 film reviews (good or bad) for training and 25,000 reviews for testing*. The problem is deciding whether a given movie review is positive or negative. The data were collected by researchers at Stanford  and  used in a 2011 paper that used 50-50  data  for training and testing. An accuracy of 88.89% is achieved. \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b0e6858a","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.010466,"end_time":"2022-02-15T05:47:23.997744","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-02-15T05:47:23.987278","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["**Import modules**\n","\n","Let's start off with the basic step of importing all the relevant modules and functions required for this particular classifier."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"3346a970","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-15T05:47:24.02308Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-15T05:47:24.022057Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-15T05:47:30.677625Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-15T05:47:30.676542Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-15T05:34:25.31555Z"},"papermill":{"duration":6.669347,"end_time":"2022-02-15T05:47:30.677829","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-02-15T05:47:24.008482","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd    # to load dataset\n","import numpy as np     # for mathematic equation\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from nltk.corpus import stopwords   # to get collection of stopwords\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split       # for splitting dataset\n","from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer  # to encode text to int\n","from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences   # to do padding or truncating\n","from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential     # the model\n","from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense # layers of the architecture\n","from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint   # save model\n","from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model   # load saved model\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ed468a4b","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.010598,"end_time":"2022-02-15T05:47:30.699747","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-02-15T05:47:30.689149","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["Firstly, let's learn about our dataset.
